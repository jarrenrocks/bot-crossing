 * arrived, and `cmd /c start` parses its own argument line, where the `%3A%5C` escapes in that
 * same link are exactly what it expands.
 *
 * The spawn is guarded because the opener may simply not be installed — a headless Linux box
 * has no `xdg-open` — and an unhandled `error` event on a child process takes the whole server
