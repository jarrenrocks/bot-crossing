/**
 * Three-way merge of a colony state.
 *
 * The colony file is written whole, by a page that read it once at boot. That is fine while
 * there is only ever one tab: the page holds the truth and the file is its shadow. With two
 * tabs it is two writers on one file, and the losing write is silent — the tab that saves last
 * simply pastes over everything the other one did since it loaded. In practice that looks like
 * a plot you moved snapping back, or a thread you archived reappearing on its own.
 *
 * The server refuses a save whose base is stale and hands back what is on disk, so the page can
 * work out what it actually changed rather than asserting its whole picture. Hence three
 * inputs: `base` is the state as this tab last saw it agree with disk, `local` is what this tab
 * holds now, `remote` is what is on disk. The result keeps the other tab's work and replays
 * this tab's own edits on top of it.
 *
 * Pure and browser-free on purpose: this is the one piece worth being able to run under bare
 * node, since every way of getting it wrong is a way of losing somebody's archive list.

/**
 * Structural equality, deep enough for the values that actually live in this file: `plots`
 * holds arrays of `[q, r]` integer pairs and `seen` holds numbers. Reference equality is no use
 * here — every one of these values is rebuilt from scratch on each poll, so a cell list that
 * never moved is still a different array than the one in `base`, and comparing by identity
 * would call every single zone "changed by this tab" and defeat the merge.
